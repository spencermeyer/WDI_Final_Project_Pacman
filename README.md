# WDI_Final_Project_Pacman
A Pacman game written for my final project of WDI at General Assembly. 

by Spencer Meyer

This is work in progress that is due to be presented on Friday 5th June at General Assembly, London.

Features:

*Uses forward looking into the pixels in front of an object (either the pacman or the ghosts) to see if there are any blue pixels (i.e. a wall) and prevent movement forward if this is the case.  The advantage of this technique is that new background images could be quickly added and used.

*Uses collision handlers to determine if a pacman has collided with either a pacdot, a powerdot or a ghost and takes the appropriate action.

*Uses a random generator to determine the direction of the ghosts.
